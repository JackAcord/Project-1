/* The following code in this javascript is a combination of a post on StackOverflow about how to get a score into a quiz type program, some of the responses ammending the code, and my own guess work, most of it naturally spelled out in these comments.*/

// This is showing what the answers to the questions are.
//The brackets are showing that a new array is being created.
var answers = ["c","c","b","a","b","c","d","d","a","b"];
	tot = answers.length;

//The code here is obtaining the checked values of each question
function getCheckedValue(radioName){
	var radios = document.getElementsByName(radioName);//This gets the radio group by their names
	for(var y=0; y<radios.length; y++)
		if(radios[y].checked) {
		return radios[y].value
		}//This confirms the radio button's value
}

//The following code is to determine what score the player has gotten.
function getScore(){
	var score = 0;
	for (var i=0; i<tot; i++)
		if(getCheckedValue("question"+i) === answers[i]){
		score += 1;
		} else {
			score += 0;
		} //This is actually detemining if the answer is right and how it is scored
	return score;
}

//This is going to display the score
function returnScore(){
	alert("You have gotten "+ getScore() + " out of " + tot + " correct. Nice Job.");
}
